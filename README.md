# PitchforkScrapers

This is a repository for scrapers for the music review site Pitchfork.com. The only scraper here thus far is made from BeautifulSoup, and it creates a database file that stores the average album review score for each artist. 
The number of albums scraped depends on the number of pages the user decides to input.
